How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this using the Country Flags API. I used the input value to search the API for that specific corresponding country's flag. If the input value matches the country name, the guess is correct!

Optimizations

I made this originally with no design, however added some basic CSS to make the game more playable. With more time I would find another API which uses corresponding country codes and responds with the country name, as this did not include the name. This would allow for every flag in the world.

Lessons Learned:
This is one of my first ever projects! I had a great time building with an API for the first time and making something people could actually use.
